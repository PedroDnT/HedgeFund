# Hedge Fund Agent Team for Brazilian Markets

An adaptation of [virattt's hedge-fund-agent-team](https://gist.github.com/virattt/0e4c7740472177a327b61449c9af721d), modified to analyze Brazilian market stocks using BRAPI API. The project implements a multi-agent system where each agent specializes in different aspects of financial analysis.

## Project Structure

- **Orquestra.py**: Main orchestration file that:
  - Configures and manages the agent team
  - Defines agent roles and behaviors
  - Handles the workflow between agents
  - Processes user queries and generates final analysis

- **tools.py**: Contains all BRAPI API tool implementations:
  - Financial statement tools (income statements, balance sheets)
  - Market data tools (quotes, listings)
  - Analysis tools (key statistics, financial data)
  - Economic indicators (inflation, prime rate)

- **prettyprint.py**: Handles output formatting:
  - Rich text formatting for terminal output
  - Custom styling for different message types
  - Organized display of analysis results

- **brapi_wrapper.py**: API wrapper interface:
  - Imports tools from tools.py
  - Provides high-level access to BRAPI endpoints

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Analysis**:
  - Fundamental Analyst: Financial statements and company health
  - Valuation Analyst: Market data and valuation ratios
  - Price Analyst: Price action and trends

- **BRAPI Integration**:
  - Real-time market data
